There are two really big limitations for this process
  -1. Topolbuild can only handle a small system like system includes hundreds of atoms. When the system becomes really big, like thousands atoms, the charge calculation met some problems.
  -2. The topology file that topolbuild give it to us has some really big problem when the system hit 20k atoms.
  
These two limitations make me think another approach to build the system.
